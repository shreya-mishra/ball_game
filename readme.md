Requirements were :

- Create buttons on your Ul representing your arrow keys on the keyboard.

- If the arrow key on keyboard is pressed down and not released, the same button in your Ul shows a held down effect.

- The arrow key button on the UI can also be held down with the mouse.

- Create a container and generate a target box of 150 X 150px and a small circle of 25 X 25px at random locations.

- Based on what arrow key is being pressed down, move the circle 10px per second in that direction.

- If the circle is completely within the target box, then display a success message on the screen.

**Space Requirement**

- Create 3 containers

- The controls in previous container should move the dot in next container

- If the dot moves inside one of the control buttons, it presses that button down
